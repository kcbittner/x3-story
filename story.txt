Shreyans Saraogi: 
A friend of Kaylee, Shrey got the permission to add something to the story- so he just thought about what to wirte in the story and he wasted hours doing that.

Bon realize that they don't have to write their name with the part they add, so he decided to tell the others:"Hey, we don't need to add our name in the text because the commit history shows who did what already!"
Bon also write this part because he forgot that he should not name his commit "first paragraph"

Shreyans Saraogi
